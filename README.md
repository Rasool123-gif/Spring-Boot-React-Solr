Technologies Used:<br>

(1) React<br>
(2) Java Spring Boot<br>
(3) Apache Solr<br>

In Apache Solr, the Core which is used is "Movie". <br>
The dataset which is used in this core is "movies.csv".<br>

Here Java Spring Boot is used for creating API's, mostly we used get method to fetch the documents.<br>
React is used for creating the Graphical User Interface for displaying the results.<br> 
And it is connected with backend Spring Boot using axios npm package.<br>
Spring Boot is connected with Apache Solr, the connections are made in application.properties file (src/main/resources/).<br>
